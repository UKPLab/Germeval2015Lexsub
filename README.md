# Germeval2015Lexsub

This repository contains example code that demonstrates how to query the H2 Uby database made available for the Germeval Lexsub shared task at GSCL 2015.

Please contact miller@ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de to obtain the H2 Uby database containing GermaNet 9.0, WordNet 3.0, the Interlingual Index, and the German OntoWiktionary, and a linking between OntoWiktionary and GermaNet based on Verena Henrich's manually checked GermaNet - Wiktionary linking.

Then download the zipped Maven project https://github.com/judithek/Germeval2015Lexsub/blob/master/de.germeval.lexsub.uby.h2.demo.7z, 
unzip it and import it as a Maven project. Place the H2 Uby database into the target folder and try the examples.
